<h1> Data Visualization</h1>

![What-is-Data-Visualization-Blog-Header](https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Data-Visualization-using-python/assets/105432776/ea30609d-c156-4c80-b701-05194192e6a6)

<br>
--> Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format(Example: charts, graphs, and maps). <br><br>
--> Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. <br><br>
--> Data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyzing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions.<br><br>
--> The concept of using pictures is to understand data that has been used for centuries. General types of data visualization are Charts, Tables, Graphs, Maps, Dashboards.
