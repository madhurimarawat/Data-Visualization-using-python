--> Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format(Example: charts, graphs, and maps). <br><br>
--> Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. <br><br>
--> Data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyzing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions.<br><br>
--> The concept of using pictures is to understand data that has been used for centuries. General types of data visualization are Charts, Tables, Graphs, Maps, Dashboards.

# Dataset Used

<h2>Automobile Dataset</h2>
--> This contains data about various automobile in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of automobile-mileage,length,body-style among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[60 rows X 6 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>

<h1>Libraries Used</h1>
<p>Short Description about all libraries used.</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy (Numerical Python) â€“ Enables with collection of mathematical functions
to operate on array and matrices. </li>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
<li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
<li>Seaborn - It is an extension of Matplotlib library used to create more attractive and
informative statistical graphics.</li>
<li>SciPy (Scientific Python) - used for scientific computation. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special
functions, FFT, signal and image processing</li>
<li>Scikit-learn - It is a machine learning library that enables tools for used for many other
machine learning algorithms such as classification, prediction, etc.</li>
<li>Geopandas-GeoPandas, as the name suggests, extends the popular data science library pandas by adding support for geospatial data.</li>
</ul>
